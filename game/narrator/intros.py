""" The INTRO is divided into two parts. INTRO_1 sets the setting and maybe
    also changes the Propp state. INTRO_2 is the branch to the first chapter;
    it may further alter the story state, and is responsible for setting up the
    starting city + campaign entrance position via the LOCALE subplot.

    The INTRO creates the first chapter.

    The INTRO creates both the LOCALE and the COMPLICATION.
